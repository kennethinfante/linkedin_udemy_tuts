## KPIs
* KPIs
    * Specific, measurable goals
    * Directly tied to theory of biz
    * Reflect goals within perspectives
    * Incentivize desired behaviour
    * Lead to desired results

* SMART vs FAST
    * SMART
        - Specific
        - Measurable
        - Achievable
        - Realistic
        - Time-bound

    * FAST
        - Frequently discussed
        - Ambitious
        - Specific
        - Transparent

* Be both SMART and FAST

## Process and Results Matter

* A balanced scorecard is a theory of the business
* KPIs must match theory
* Mix of leading and lagging indicators

* Lagging
    - Revenue growth
    - Customer retention
    - New product revenue
    - Employee satisfaction

* Leading
    - Revenue mix
    - Customer satisfaction
    - Product development cycle
    - Personal goals and alignment

* Cause and Effect

    - Need not have equal # of leading and lagging
    - Should tie to compensation

* Formulation is a team effort
    - Team must extend well beyond the boardroom
    - Incentives must encourate desirable outcomes

## Generate and maintain momentum

* Accentuate the positive
    - Share as much as you can
    - (but) Keep some information proprietory - use indexes

* Use storytelling
    - Reinforce goals indirectly
    - Encourage and reward employees (contributing to the goal)

* Avoiding surrogation
    - Loosen link between individual metrics and incentives

## Measure Program Effectiveness
* Details matter
    - Look for cause-effect relationships

* Identify trends over time
    - All changes require adaptaition

* Identify Root causes
    - Five Whys

* Adaptation is Vital
    * Anticipate > Challenge > Interpret > Decide > Align > Learn
