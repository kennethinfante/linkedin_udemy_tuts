# Python Data Structures

This is a combination of my notes of Data Structures courses in Linkedin Learning. I'm focusing on the applications

* Set
    - get unique characters
    - set operations (Venn diagram)
    
* Frozen set
    - immutable set

* Stacks
    - Palindrome checker

* Queue
    - Printer problem (printing documents in a queue)


* Linked List
    - Getting midpoint traversing only once
    - White traversing, remove duplicates

* Collections
    * Counter
        - value_counts
        - 
    * Deque
        - Palindrome checker
        - Scheduling tasks with Priority
        - Storing most recent order
        - matching parentheses
        - generate binary numbers

    * namedtuple
        - reading csv files

    * defaultdict
        - cleaning up duplicates
        - Calculating gain and loss
